# Backend App

## Overview

The backend app is responsible for handling the server-side functionality of the application. It provides the necessary APIs and services to support the frontend and facilitate communication with the database.

## Features

- API Endpoints: The backend app exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints to perform various operations such as retrieving data, creating new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

- Authentication and Authorization: The app includes authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources and perform specific actions.

- Database Integration: The backend app integrates with a database system to store and retrieve data. It handles the necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with the database.

- Error Handling: The app includes robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle and report any errors that may occur during the execution of API requests.

- Logging and Monitoring: The app logs important events and activities, allowing for easy troubleshooting and monitoring of the application's performance.
